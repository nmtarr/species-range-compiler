    "This document supports the develoment and demonstration of rules for GAP range and presence code assignment.  Multiple types of information are assessed (opinion, occurrence data, and previous presence codes) and they sometimes conflict, thus rules for handling cases of disagreement are needed.  In the future, rules for handling model predictions would be incorporated as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook a dataframe of all possible combinations of\n",
    "codes is built and then a presence column is filled out according to clearly specified rules. The results are then tested and can be referenced for understanding presence code assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, opinions must be reconciled and cleaned up prior to application.  The rules and and assumptions for those processes are also presented in this document.  \n",

    "__Sections__\n",
    "1. Information Hierarchy -- A dataframe is built that specifies rules of dominance for various information sources.\n",
    "2. Opinion Processing -- Cleaning and reconciliation processes are detailed and a dataframe is built that shows the opinion weight values for all expert rank and confidence values, as well as which would win or lose against a previous map.  Expert opinion confidence values are collected from the expert when they submit opinions.\n",
    "3. Coding Rules -- First, a dataframe with all types of information combinations is built.  2011-2015 is used as an example time period.  Second, that dataframe is populated according to rules.  Finally, tests are run to ensure all cases were accounted for and certain values are present where they should be.\n",

    "* Rules are applied here to a single time period (2015) but in the range compiler script, multiple periods are assessed.\n",

    "The following table illustrates the information hierarchy that the range compilation processes adhere to.  Documented refers to documented presence or range based upon observational data.  Opinion is collected from experts or GAP staff.  The temporal grain of the processes means that compiled data from previous time periods or GAP version 1 range data may be available. "

Each tables has a row for opinions stored at the level of the spatial unit and year.  As opinion is collected, duplication and conflicts can arise that need to be addresssed before application.  The collection expert confidence and rank scores facilitates a way to systematically and consistently resolve conflicts by calculating a weight for each opinion.  Weight is calculates as rank*(confidence/10) and is scaled between 0 and 10.\n",
